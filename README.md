## Database Schema

The system consists of the following core tables:

- `users`  
- `vehicles`  
- `parking_lots`  
- `parking_slots`  
- `bookings`  
- `payments`  
- `parking_sensors`  
- `access_control`  
- `logs`  
- `violations`  
- `staff`  
- `subscription_plans`  
- `user_subscriptions`  
- `discounts`  
- `booking_discounts`  

Additionally, audit tables are implemented for critical actions on bookings, payments, and parking sensors.
